## Flashing

> [!WARNING]
> Bricking the Car Thing is nearly impossible, but the risk is always there when flashing custom firmware.

### Requirements

- Terbium driver is required on Windows: `irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex` (Powershell)

### Steps

1. Download an installer zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-image/releases)
2. Plug in your Car Thing's USB while holding 1+4 (buttons at the top)
3. Follow the instructions on [Terbium](https://terbium.app) to flash your Car Thing using the downloaded zip file

Flashing will likely take about 10 minutes, depending on your USB ports and some other factors. Please try multiple ports if one isn’t working (Rear IO USB 3/2, BIOS flash port if on AMD, etc).

### Uninstall

Use a tool of your choice (likely Terbium) to flash stock or a different firmware.

## Setting up Network

<summary><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4fcc48-5f86-4ea6-90b2-29bf938a2de0" height="14" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Bluetooth (recommended)</summary>

Since Nocturne 3.0.0, Bluetooth via tethering is supported.

1. While on the Connection Lost screen, connect to `Nocturne (XXXX)` from your phone (XXXX being the last 4 characters of your Car Thing's serial number).
2. Enable Bluetooth tethering on your phone:
   * iOS: Turn on Personal Hotspot
   * Android: Turn on hotspot and/or Bluetooth tethering

**Tip:** Make sure your Car Thing is not connected to a computer, as this conflicts with Bluetooth.

Nocturne Connector requires a Raspberry Pi, but adds Wi-Fi support to your Car Thing while it's connected to the Pi.

See more on the [Nocturne Connector GitHub](https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-connector).

<summary><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Windows_logo_-_2021.svg" height="14" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Windows</summary>

The Car Thing running Nocturne presents itself as a virtual network adapter. With some configuration, you can share your internet connection to the Car Thing via USB tethering.

**Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise is required**. If you are on Home, you may configure the adapter manually via the Network and Sharing Center GUI.

1. Connect the Car Thing to your PC.
2. Run the following commands in an elevated PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
$ctNic = (Get-NetAdapter -InterfaceDescription "*NDIS*")

$ctNic | Set-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 172.16.42.1 -PrefixLength 24

New-NetNat -Name "CarThing" -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 172.16.42.0/24
```

**Tip:** If you get an error akin to a duplicate name being in use, you may need to identify conflicts on your system with `Get-VMSwitch`. If you do not have that command installed, you will need to install the Hyper-V optional Windows feature, following a reboot, with: `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online | Where-Object FeatureName -like '*Hyper-V*'`.

## Donate

Nocturne is a massive endeavor, and the team have spent everyday over the last few months making it a reality out of our passion for creating something that people like you love to use.

All donations are split between the four members of the Nocturne team, and go towards the development of future features. We are so grateful for your support!

## Building

`curl`, `zip/unzip`, `genimage`, `m4`, `xbps-install`, and `mkpasswd` binaries are required. xbps-install can be installed on any distro by using the [static binaries](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/troubleshooting/static.html).

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not extract the xbps-static tar to your rootfs without being careful or else you may end up with a broken system. The following command has worked for me, but you have been warned.
>
> `sudo tar --no-overwrite-dir --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions -xvf xbps-static-latest.x86_64-musl.tar.xz -C /` 

If you are on an architecture other than arm64, qemu-user-static (+ binfmt, or use `docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes`) is required.

Use the `Justfile`. `just run` will output a flashable Car Thing image in `output`.

```
$ just -l
Available recipes:
  build
  copy
  lint
  run
  shell
```
